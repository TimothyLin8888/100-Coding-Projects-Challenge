# Simple Counter App

## Project Overview

This is a very simple counter app built by using React, featuring:

- Incrementing the counter by 1

- Decrementing the counter by 1

- Reseting the counter back to 0

It was created to help track attempts when hunting for shiny Pokémon. While the app currently includes a small, limited selection of Pokémon, you can pick one and view an image of its shiny version—similar to how they appear in Pokémon HOME.

This is Project #2 of my 100 Coding Projects Challenge. I plan to expand this idea later—maybe around Project #21—by using the PokéAPI to add real-time Pokémon data and make the app more dynamic.

## Technologies Used

- React: A library that is used for web development in the frontend that counts the number of encounters.

- HTML/CSS: For basic frontend structure and styling.

## Future Plans

Add PokéAPI integration to fetch Pokémon data dynamically

Improve the UI with animations or better styling

Allow more Pokémon selection options

Add shiny odds tracking and attempt history

# User Authenication System

## Project Overview

The User Authentication System is a basic web application built with Django that allows users to register, log in, and log out. The application includes:

- User registration with a unique username and password.

- User login and authentication.

- Secure login/logout functionality.

- Redirect to a protected page after login to display a "Logged In" message.

This system demonstrates the core principles of user authentication in web applications, allowing users to securely sign up, log in, and access protected resources.

## Features

- User Registration: New users can register with a unique username and password.

- User Login: Registered users can log in to access the protected parts of the site.

- Logout: Users can log out and be redirected to the login page.

- Login Redirect: After logging in, users are redirected to a page displaying a confirmation message.

## Technologies Used

- Django: Python-based web framework for building the backend and handling authentication.

- SQLite: Default database used by Django (or you can switch to another database like PostgreSQL or MySQL).

- HTML/CSS: For basic frontend structure and styling.
